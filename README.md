# Android Final project Tel-hai Collage


Our project provides users with real-time news sourced from the Guardian API. The application features a comprehensive collection of the latest news articles, organized into tabs for easy navigation based on categories such as global news, science, sports, and more.

When a user selects an article of interest, they are seamlessly directed to an HTML page within the application itself, where they can conveniently read the content without leaving the app environment. Additionally, users can effortlessly share articles through standard sharing options accessible via the dedicated sharing icon accompanying each article in the list.

This application aims to deliver a streamlined and user-friendly platform for accessing and engaging with up-to-date news content from around the world.
